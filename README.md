1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.

2. What five objects are created in the main?

		The five objects that are created in the main are the ArrayList of type Dog, the three Dogs
	that populated said ArrayList, and the new Animal Comparator.  

3. Can you spot the Comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the Comparator?

		The comparator construction call is on line 16 in the collections.sort() method, and the definition is
	done in an inline manner immediately after the instantiation of the comparator.
